##Part 1 
The circumference of a circle is calculated by 2rtr, where r< = 3.14159 (rounded to five decimal p
laces). Write a function called print circum that takes an argument for the circle's radius and prints the circle's radius. 
Call your print_circum function three times with different values for radius. 
Include the following in your part 1 submission: 
• The code for your print_circum function. • The inputs and outputs to three calls of your print_circum. 

##Part 2 
Welcome to your first project. Develop a catalog for a company. Assume that this company sells three different Items. The seller can sell individual items or a combination of any two items. A gift pack is a special combination that contains all three items. Here are some special considerations: 
A. If a customer purchases individual items, he does not receive any discount. B. If a customer purchases a combo pack with two unique items, he gets a 10% discount. C. If the customer purchases a gift pack, he gets a 25% discount. 
Write a function for the above scenario. Perform the calculations in code wherever applicable. The function should be your own creation, not copied from any other source. The final output should look like: 
Output:
Online Store
Product(S) Price
Item 1 200.8
Item 2 400.8
Item 3 600.0
Combo 1(Item 1 + 2) 540.0
Combo 2(Item 2 + 3) 900.8
Combo 3(Item 1 + 3) 728.0
Combo 4(Item 1 + 2 + 3) 900.0
