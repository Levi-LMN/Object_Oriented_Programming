Write a Python function called is_palindrome that takes a string as input and returns True if the string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward), and False otherwise. The function should ignore spaces, capitalization, and punctuation when checking if a string is a palindrome.

For example:

"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!" is a palindrome.
"Race car" is a palindrome.
"Hello, World!" is not a palindrome.
Your function should be able to handle both cases and return the correct results.

Constraints:

The input string will have at most length 10^5.
You can assume that the input only contains printable ASCII characters.
