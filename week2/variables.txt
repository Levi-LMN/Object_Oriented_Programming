Variables and Assignments
In Python, variables are used to store and manipulate data. A variable is essentially a name that refers to a value stored in memory. You can think of a variable as a container that holds different types of data, such as numbers, text, or more complex structures.

Variable Naming Rules

Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
After the initial letter or underscore, variable names can contain letters, digits (0-9), and underscores.
Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning myVariable and myvariable are treated as different variables.
It's a good practice to use descriptive variable names to make your code more readable.
Assigning Values to Variables

In Python, you use the = operator to assign a value to a variable. Here are some examples:

# Assigning values to variables
x = 10
name = "Alice"
pi = 3.14159
is_python_fun = True


Certainly! Let's dive deeper into variables and assignments in Python.

Assigning Values to Variables
In Python, you use the = operator to assign a value to a variable. Here are some examples:

python
Copy code
# Assigning values to variables
x = 10
name = "Alice"
pi = 3.14159
is_python_fun = True
In the examples above:

x is assigned the integer value 10.
name is assigned the string value "Alice".
pi is assigned the floating-point value 3.14159.
is_python_fun is assigned the boolean value True.
You can change the value of a variable by assigning it a new value:

x = 20  # Change the value of x to 20


Variable Data Types
Python is dynamically typed, which means that you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable. The interpreter determines the data type based on the value assigned to the variable.

Here are some common data types in Python:

int: Integers, e.g., 42, -7, 0.
float: Floating-point numbers, e.g., 3.14, -0.5.
str: Strings, e.g., "Hello, Python!".
bool: Booleans, either True or False.

# Variables with different data types
age = 25  # int
pi = 3.14159  # float
greeting = "Hello, Python!"  # str
is_python_fun = True  # bool


Variable Reassignment
You can change the value of a variable by reassigning it to a new value. This is one of the powerful features of variables in Python.

x = 10  # Initial assignment
x = x + 5  # Reassignment, now x is 15

In this example, the value of x is first assigned as 10, and then it is reassigned to x + 5, which results in 15.
