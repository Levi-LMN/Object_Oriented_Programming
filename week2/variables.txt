## Variables and Assignments

In Python, variables are used to store and manipulate data. A variable is essentially a name that refers to a value stored in memory. You can think of a variable as a container that holds different types of data, such as numbers, text, or more complex structures.

### Variable Naming Rules

- Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
- After the initial letter or underscore, variable names can contain letters, digits (0-9), and underscores.
- Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning `myVariable` and `myvariable` are treated as different variables.
- It's a good practice to use descriptive variable names to make your code more readable.

### Assigning Values to Variables

In Python, you use the `=` operator to assign a value to a variable. Here are some examples:

```python
# Assigning values to variables
x = 10
name = "Alice"
pi = 3.14159
is_python_fun = True
