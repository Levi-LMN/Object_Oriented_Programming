Types of Python Operators
    Arithmetic operators
    Assignment Operators
    Comparison Operators
    Logical Operators
    Bitwise Operators
    Special Operators


Example 1: Arithmetic Operators in Python
a = 7
b = 2
# addition
print ('Sum: ', a + b)  
# subtraction
print ('Subtraction: ', a - b)   
# multiplication
print ('Multiplication: ', a * b)  
# division
print ('Division: ', a / b) 
# floor division
print ('Floor Division: ', a // b)
# modulo
print ('Modulo: ', a % b)  
# a to the power b
print ('Power: ', a ** b)   



Example 2: Assignment Operators
# assign 10 to a
a = 10
# assign 5 to b
b = 5 
# assign the sum of a and b to a
a += b      # a = a + b
print(a)


Example 3: Comparison Operators
a = 5
b = 2
# equal to operator
print('a == b =', a == b)
# not equal to operator
print('a != b =', a != b)
# greater than operator
print('a > b =', a > b)
# less than operator
print('a < b =', a < b)
# greater than or equal to operator
print('a >= b =', a >= b)
# less than or equal to operator
print('a <= b =', a <= b)



Example 4: Logical Operators
# logical AND
print(True and True)     # True
print(True and False)    # False
# logical OR
print(True or False)     # True
# logical NOT
print(not True)          # False
